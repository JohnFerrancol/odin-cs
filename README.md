## Overview

These are a series of projects/exercises from the [Odin Project](): [A Bit of Computer Science](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript/courses/javascript#a-bit-of-computer-science). This is where we applied knowledge learnt on various projects such on Data Structures and Algorithms to help apply this knowledge to make websites perform more efficiently.

## Learning Points

- [x] Learnt what exactly are Data Structures and Algorithms
- [x] Learnt how to use recursive functions through the Fibonacci Sequence and Merge Sort
- [x] Learnt how to measure efficiency of code from Time and Space complexity using the Big O notation
- [x] Learnt what are stacks and queues
- [x] Learnt how to implement a Linked List data structure in Javscript
- [x] Learnt how to implement a Hash Map data structure in Javscript
- [x] Learnt how to implement a Binary Search Tree structure in Javascript
- [x] Understood Tree Traversal Algorithms (Breadth-First Search and Depth First Search - In Order, Pre Order, Post Order)
